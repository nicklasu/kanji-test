# kanji-test
This is a kanji testing application for those who are interested in knowing their JLPT kanji knowledge level. 

The app is deployed in the following link:
https://kanji-test-rho.vercel.app/

For Kanji and JLPT data, I am using "kanji-jouyou.json" from the following repository:
https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data

# Views
From the main view, the user can select which level of JLPT they would like to try.

In the test view, the user can select whether they know or do not know the kanji.

When the test is over, the user can see their results and also search for kanji information on jisho.org
